# Thirteenth journal

## 07/1/2017

Friday is the last day of project week. Also today is the day we present our project in front of a Code Fellows audience.

In the morning I met with the team and we went through some rehearsal until it was our time to do a live rehearsal in the presentation area. Tracey was watching, and later she gave us few important feedback.

We watched the Friday speaker around noon, and after that it was time for the presentation.
It was a good experience practicing presentations and seeing other people's work.
