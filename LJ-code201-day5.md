On Friday we learned how to approach and diagnose errors in our code. We talked about debugging, using break points and how our code actually works in terms of order of execution.

During the lab we have a pair programming assignment, and I was paired with La doing a HTML CSS project named: Chocolate pizza.

We printed out the mvp and had a copy of the website that we will be building, and we started working on our plan of execution. We then started the HTML layout of the page, and once that was done we started working on our styling.
We also switched roles between driver and navigator and we were able to have most of the work done by the time it was due at 6pm. I think we did more than 95% of the project, but we didn't have enough time to finish the last few things.

Overall working with La was a great experience and I think that we formed a great team together.
