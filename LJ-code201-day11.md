Today we continued working on our javascript. We linked each quiz to its appropriate image, and then we worked on the logic to get how many answers were correct and add the score accordingly.

We then worked on the index.html to get the user name from the text input and save it to local storage so we can use it in the quiz page.
We also worked on the local storage on the quiz page and tried to get the score for each quiz and push that to local storage in order to have a score board page with multiple users and multiple scores for them to be able to compare performance.

That's when we hit a road block and spent the next 7 hours trying to figure out a way to grab those two variables score and user name, may be put them in an object, and save them to local storage while still have the access to them in the future to render that to the score board page. The final goal was to have multiple users and scores, all in local storage, ready to be placed on a scored board to get the highest score competition between users.
