Friday it was last day on my first week of 301 at Code Fellows.
In the morning I continued working on my portfolio project and was able to finish the individual lab assignment and make good progress with my website.

Now I have tabs for every link in my navbar where home will show only the home section, about: will only show the about-me and portfolio will show my portfolio section.

I also styled my footer links and main section image.

Today I was paired with JP and we did a great job on our code together. There is some few things we still need to finish.
