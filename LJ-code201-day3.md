Today we learned about the DOM and domain problem. The demo was very clear and made sense, but when I started the lab assignment I ran into some obstacles.

The way I approached this problem was by following the mvp and the support.md and break it down to small pieces.
After I was able to push my randomly generated cookie count to my array, things started to clear up in my mind and I was able to see what I was doing and where I was suppose to be heading.

My next challenge was how to get the hours at the beginning of every 'li' to say 6 am, 7am, etc.
The way I did it was, I used my loop to hit 2 birds with one stone:
set the li.textContent to i + 6 + ' am'(to start with 6 am because i initially was 0) and concatenate that to my array[i] + ' cookies.' to get the randomly generated cookies stored in my array.

exemple of final product: 6 am: 16 cookies.

Overall this challenge was very well made. It pushed me to where I thought I was not going to be able to finish and successfully run my code. But when I finally figured it out... It was amazing!
