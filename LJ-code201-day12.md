Thursday was our forth day of the project week. On Wednesday we were still working on our local storage, and we had few road blocks along the way.

I continued working on local storage, while my teammates started working on styling the html pages.
After couple of hours, I was able to finally get the local storage to run properly and grab the user name from the first page, save it, go to the quiz page, take the score and save it, and finally go the score board page and render the user name and score on that page.

After that I started working on styling the game.html page and get some finish touches done to get the page launched.
