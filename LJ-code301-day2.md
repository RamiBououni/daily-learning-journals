Today is the 3rd day in 301.
I continued working on my portfolio in the individual assignment and I was able to make some good progress.
My goal now is to try to meet all my MVPs first before tackling any other tasks.

For pair programming today I was paired with Jose and we worked on jQuery events.
I think we were a good team and we got a lot done. There is only one ToDo left and we plan on finishing it tomorrow.
