Today we started the 3rd week in code fellows. This week project is bus-mall.
During demo I was able to follow along with Stephanie and was able to understand the process.

During lab, our assignment started with writing your user stories for the project and taking the time to make a plan before starting to write any line of code.

While making a plan before writing the code was a great way to collect my thoughts and know how to approach the challenge, I wasn't really thrilled about writing the 4 or 5 user stories for each of the 3 categories of users we have. But I understand that not every thing we will do in our job will align 100% with what I like. So I got it done.

Next I started to make different functions for random name from array of images, image render and setup functions.

After I created my constructor and my objects for each of the images, I was able write my logic to eliminate duplicates for the current set of images.

The most challenging thing for me is how am I going to eliminate the duplicates for the previous set of images...
