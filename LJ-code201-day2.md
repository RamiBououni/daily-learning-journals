Today we started learning functions. So our assignment was to replace all our previous guessing game questions with functions().

Also today was our first pair programming exercise where we fork each other's repo and work on it, then make a pull request and have it accepted and merged.

Today I worked with Quinn, so we switched roles between driver and navigator.

Also I kept working on my code for exercise 6 and 7 javascript from yesterday and made some progress where I don't have this continuous loop bug anymore. I still need to replace my hard coded if statement and make the for loop work with the if.(for some reason when I put the for loop then the if statement, it doesn't work for some reason).
