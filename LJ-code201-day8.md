Today is Sunday, tomorrow we will start the last week of 201. It is project week. I'm in a team of 3 with Sugey and Britini. We decided to do the smart quiz project where you pick one image, and each image has a specific theme, and according to that theme you get a quiz about that specific subject.

Friday we finished our user scenarios and worked on our user stories as well. We pitched the idea and all is good.
Monday we will start the project.

Saturday I worked on my resubmits and got a lot done. I also took the exam entry test for the 301 and got 96%.
