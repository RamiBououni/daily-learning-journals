Today we learned about Ajax and Json and how they interact together.
We used a data file to get the data from there and add it and retrieve from the local storage while using the .get() method to retrieve the data and set our 2 functions for success and error accordingly.

For the lab, I was paired with Quinn and we did our best to finish as much as possible since we did not have enough time left because the lecture was longer today because we ran into some issues with the code and also because we had many questions after our introduction to Ajax and JSON.
