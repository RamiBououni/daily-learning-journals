Today I continued working on my bus-mall website. I was trying to figure out how to show my data for each image shown, which took me a while. Today while I was on my way here I finally figured it out in the car and was able to get the data to show with numbers of clicks and shows for each image.

That was such a relief after struggling for almost 2 days. Then when I had to do my chart, I was able to solve that since I had that data available. Then finished my code with getting this data to be persistent.

It started as a very challenging assignment but I stuck to it and it paid off. Glad I was able to solve this on time. I learned a lot.
