# Code 301 journal

## Seventh journal

### 07/25/2017

Monday is the first day in week 3 in 301. We learned about history api and page.js.

For the lab, I was paired with Drew and we worked on adding page.js features to our website so we can stop using the nav event handler.

We were able to finish the lab and also finish the stretch goal by adding the admin controllers for the status page.
