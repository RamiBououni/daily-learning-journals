# Code 301 journal

## Sixth journal

### 07/23/2017

Friday was the last day in week 2 in 301. We learned about functional programming.

For the lunch and learn, the speaker was a software developer working at Alaska airline.
It is good to learn from someone working in a big corporation and not at a startup company and what are the differences between the two environments.

I was paired with Aeonne today and we worked on switching our code to functional programming syntax. We still need to finish few things.
