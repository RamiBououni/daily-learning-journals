Wednesday was our first introduction to SQL. We created some tables in the demo along with Stephanie and we were following along to get the data from that database and render it to our page.

During lab, I was teamed with La and Quinn and we worked on the assignment collectively.
We still have have few things to finish for this morning but overall we got most of it done.

After school I went to a meetup at General Assembly titled: writing a better user stories.
I went with La, Aeonne, Quinn and Dan and we eat some pizza and met some people and enjoyed an informative presentation.
