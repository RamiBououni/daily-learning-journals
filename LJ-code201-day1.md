# This is my first journal entry:

## day2

Today it is my second day in class. We continued to learn javascript today and we are building upon what we learned yesterday using prompt, alert, and the console.log().

I was comfortable writing the HTML, CSS and even the javascript part of my lab assignment today, but my only struggle was with git commands.

We covered also the ACP: add, commit, and push git commands.

It started kinda blurry for me, and I was feeling very confused. Tracey and Brian helped me a lot with making sense of this confusion in my head. Tracey also helped me get my atom linter to finally work. So grateful.

I was also trying to apply what I learned during my lab exercise trying to:
- git add .
- git commit -m 'I'm just practicing these commands one more time'
- git push origin master
