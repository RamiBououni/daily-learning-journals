Friday was the last day in 3rd week of 301. Today the lecture started at 9 AM so we can have time to discuss our project.

We went over the requirements for the projects and best practices and then we were assigned into groups.

I was in a group of 4 with Jose, La and Ashwini.

We started the planning for our project and we decided to make an app for the class student to rate new releases movies and also movies coming out soon, for the purpose of finding common movies to go to together.

Later we worked on our last portfolio assignment to implement middleware with page.js.
