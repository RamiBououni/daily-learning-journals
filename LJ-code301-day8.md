Wednesday we learned about setting up our proxy to be the "middle man" between our client and our back end in order to prevent possible unauthorized access to our github token in the network tab in our developer tool.

We also learned the deployment process with heroku.

For the lab I was paired with Don and we worked on our starter code to set up our proxy and then deploy our app.

We were able to successfully accomplish the assignment.
