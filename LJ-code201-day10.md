# Tenth journal

Today is Tuesday, and it is our second day of project week. Today we started with a quick morning recap, and moved on to what we did last night. Each team member finished one html page layout and we were able to push and merge all those updates before we start diving in javascript.

After that we started coding javascript, and we actually accomplished several things today. We were able to finish populate each quiz to the form section area, with an event listener that trigger a different quiz for each of the different images. We also added some text area for each of the questions to let the user enter the answer and next we need to check to see if answer is correct to be able to save the score for the next page which is the score board.

Tomorrow we will try to continue working on the app.js to add more functionality to the page and especially prepare for that data to be stored in the local storage for persistence.
