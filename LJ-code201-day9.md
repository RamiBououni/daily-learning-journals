# Ninth journal

## 06/26/2017

Today is the first day of the project week. We already started the planning for our project last Friday, and today we picked up where we left off and started building a plan to help create our project.

We worked on our user stories and user scenarios and when we had those ready, we started working on our MVPs.

Next we worked on our data modeling and the technical requirements and we had a meeting with stephanie and the TAs.

We finished the day with assigning an html page to be completed for the next day by each member of the team.
