# Code 301 journal

## First journal

### 07/10/2017

Today is the first day of 301.
The structure is different so we have lectures in the afternoon after lunch, individual assignment in the mornings and pair programming from 4 to 6:30.

Today we started pair programming for the lab. I was paired with Britini to work on CSS styling.
The difference this time is that we have an existing code and we are suppose to continue working on that code and add more features.

Overall the lab assignment went well.
